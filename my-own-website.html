            <p>By Peter on the 15th January 2021<br>
                The Mercedes SLS AMG has a magnificent design. I love the gullwing doors of the car and the variety in the different colours </p>

                High depreciation within the first year of owning the car, with a 25% decrease in the first year. In addition to this, Mercedes claim that it is able to do 22mpg but you will be lucky to even do 14mpg. Avoid at all costs.</p>
